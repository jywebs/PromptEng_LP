### **Week 8: Capstone Presentations & Final Assessment (Expanded)**

---

#### **1. Introduction to Capstone Presentations (Expanded)**

- **Explain:**
  - Today is the final session, where each student or group will present their capstone projects. The purpose is to show how they used ChatGPT and the prompting techniques learned throughout the course to create something meaningful.

- **Presentation Expectations:**
  - **Project Goal:**
    - What did they create? Was it a study guide, personal portfolio, informational guide, or another useful product?
    - Why is the project important or meaningful? How will it help them in the future or support their learning?
  
  - **Use of ChatGPT:**
    - What types of prompts were used? Did they use role-based prompts, structured prompts, or specific instructions?
    - How did ChatGPT contribute to their final product? Did it help generate content, organize ideas, or provide guidance?
  
  - **Challenges and Solutions:**
    - Discuss any difficulties they encountered with ChatGPT responses.
    - How did they refine their prompts to get better results? Were adjustments needed to make the responses clearer or more accurate?

- **Encourage Reflection:**
  - Ask the students to reflect on their experience:
    - "What was the most useful thing you learned about prompting?"
    - "How did ChatGPT make your project easier or more effective?"
    - "What would you do differently if you had more time to work on your project?"

#### **2. Capstone Project Presentations (Expanded)**

- **Group or Individual Presentations:**
  - Each group or individual will take turns presenting their capstone project to the class. Encourage students to:
    - Share their **project outline** (What was the main goal? What topic did they choose?)
    - Explain the **types of prompts** they used (role-based, structured, detailed).
    - Showcase the **final product** (study guide, resume, informational guide, etc.).
    - Discuss **what worked well** with ChatGPT and how they adjusted their prompts to improve the results.
  
- **After Each Presentation:**
  - Offer time for **questions and feedback** from the class. Ask students to share constructive feedback on how effectively ChatGPT was used, as well as any ideas for improvements.
  
- **Celebrate the Achievements:**
  - Highlight the growth and learning that each student has shown throughout the course, emphasizing that the capstone project is a culmination of their skills in prompt engineering.

#### **3. Review of Effective Prompting Techniques (Expanded)**

- **Reflection on Prompting Techniques:**
  - After all the presentations, lead a class discussion on the most effective prompting techniques they’ve learned. Ask students:
    - "Which prompts gave you the best responses from ChatGPT?"
    - "Did role-based prompts (e.g., asking ChatGPT to act like a teacher) help improve the quality of your project?"
    - "How did structured prompts (e.g., asking for lists or steps) make it easier to get clear, useful responses?"

- **Summarize:**
  - Review the key prompting techniques covered in the course:
    - **Specificity:** Asking clear, detailed questions to get more focused responses.
    - **Role-based prompts:** Asking ChatGPT to act like a specific professional or character (e.g., teacher, scientist, or historian).
    - **Structured prompts:** Requesting responses in specific formats like lists, steps, or bullet points for better clarity and organization.

#### **4. Final Assessment (Expanded)**

- **Explain the Final Quiz:**
  - To complete the course, students will take a short quiz to demonstrate their ability to craft effective prompts for ChatGPT.

- **Quiz Instructions:**
  - Students must:
    1. **Craft 2 detailed prompts** for ChatGPT based on different scenarios (e.g., “Act like a teacher and explain how to write a good essay,” or “Create a list of 5 tips for preparing for a science test”).
    2. **Explain their prompt choices:** Why did they structure the prompt the way they did? What kind of response were they hoping for?

- **Emphasize:**
  - The goal of the quiz is not about getting a “right” or “wrong” answer, but about showing their understanding of how to guide ChatGPT to provide useful responses.
