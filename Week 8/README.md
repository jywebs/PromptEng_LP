### **Week 8: Capstone Presentations & Final Assessment**

#### **Objective:**

Students will present their capstone projects, review the most effective prompting techniques learned, and complete a final assessment.

---

### **Talking Points:**

#### **1. Introduction to Capstone Presentations**

- **Explain:**
  - Today is the final session, where each student or group will present their capstone projects. These presentations will show how they used ChatGPT and the skills they’ve learned throughout the course.
  
- **Presentation Expectations:**
  - Each group or individual should:
    - Explain the **project goal** (What did they create? Why is it meaningful or helpful?).
    - Discuss **how they used ChatGPT** (What types of prompts were used? How did ChatGPT contribute to the final product?).
    - Highlight any **challenges** they faced and how they solved them (e.g., adjusting prompts for better results).
  
- **Encourage Reflection:**
  - Ask students to reflect on their experience:
    - "What was the most useful thing you learned about prompting?"
    - "Did ChatGPT help you achieve your project goals?"

#### **2. Capstone Project Presentations**

- **Group or Individual Presentations:**
  - Each group or individual will take turns presenting their capstone project to the class. Encourage students to:
    - Share their **project outline** and explain the **types of prompts** they used.
    - Show the **final product** (study guide, resume, informational guide, etc.).
    - Discuss **what worked well** with ChatGPT and what they had to adjust to get better results.
  
- **After Each Presentation:**
  - Offer time for **questions and feedback** from the class. Encourage students to provide constructive feedback to their peers, focusing on how effectively ChatGPT was used and what could be improved.
  
- **Celebrate the achievements:**
  - Acknowledge that everyone’s project showcases their learning and growth throughout the course.

#### **3. Review of Effective Prompting Techniques**

- **Reflection on Prompting Techniques:**
  - After all the presentations, guide a class discussion on the most effective prompting techniques they’ve learned. Ask questions like:
    - "What types of prompts gave you the best responses from ChatGPT?"
    - "How did role-based prompts (e.g., asking ChatGPT to act like a teacher) help improve your project?"
    - "Did using structured prompts (e.g., asking for lists or steps) make it easier to get clear responses?"
  
- **Summarize:**
  - Review the key prompting techniques covered throughout the course:
    - **Specificity:** Asking clear, detailed questions.
    - **Role-based prompts:** Asking ChatGPT to act like a specific professional or character.
    - **Structured prompts:** Requesting responses in formats like lists, steps, or bullet points.

#### **4. Final Assessment**

- **Explain the Final Quiz:**
  - To complete the course, students will take a short quiz where they will demonstrate their ability to craft effective prompts.
  
- **Quiz Instructions:**
  - Students must:
    - **Craft 2 detailed prompts** for ChatGPT based on different scenarios (e.g., “Act like a teacher and explain how to write a good essay,” or “Create a list of 5 tips for preparing for a science test”).
    - **Explain their prompt choices:** Why did they structure the prompt the way they did? What kind of response were they hoping for?
  
- **Emphasize:**
  - The quiz is not about getting a “right” or “wrong” answer but about demonstrating their understanding of how to guide ChatGPT to provide useful responses.

### **Homework:**

- **None:**
  - This is the final session, so no additional homework will be assigned.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

- The capstone project presentations are a chance to demonstrate everything you’ve learned about using ChatGPT.
- **Effective prompting techniques** (specificity, role-based prompts, structured prompts) help guide ChatGPT to give better, more useful responses.
- The final assessment is a chance to show how well you understand the art of crafting prompts and explain why certain prompts work better than others.
