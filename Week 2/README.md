### **Week 2: Understanding Prompt Structure**

#### **Objective:**
Students will learn how to craft more detailed prompts to get specific types of responses from ChatGPT, focusing on specificity and clarity.

---

### **Talking Points:**

#### **1. Recap of Last Week**
- **Start with a brief recap:**
  - "Last week, we talked about what AI and ChatGPT are, and we learned what a prompt is. Today, we’ll dive deeper into how to create good prompts to get the answers you really want."
  - Ask: "Who remembers what a prompt is?"

#### **2. What Makes a Good Prompt?**
- **Introduce the key elements of a good prompt:**
  - **Specificity:** The more details you include, the better the response will be. If your prompt is vague, the answer will also be vague.
  - **Clarity:** Make sure your question is clear so ChatGPT understands exactly what you’re asking.
- **Interactive example:**
  - Ask the students: “What’s the difference between asking ChatGPT, ‘Tell me about animals,’ and ‘Tell me about the life cycle of a butterfly?’ Which one is more specific and why?”
  
#### **3. Example: Changing Tone or Style of Responses**
- **Explain that you can also control the tone or style of ChatGPT’s response by adjusting your prompt:**
  - **Formal vs. Casual:**
    - Formal example: "Can you please provide a detailed explanation of how the water cycle works?"
    - Casual example: "Hey, can you explain the water cycle in a fun and simple way?"
  - **Informative vs. Entertaining:**
    - Informative example: "Explain why recycling is important, providing data and research."
    - Entertaining example: "Can you make recycling sound exciting and cool for a school presentation?"
- **Interactive demo:** 
  - Show ChatGPT responses using both formal and casual prompts. Compare how the tone and style change based on how the question was asked.
  - Ask students to think about when they would want to use formal vs. casual responses (e.g., formal for schoolwork, casual for fun).

#### **4. How to Craft Specific Prompts**
- **Step-by-step guide to crafting specific prompts:**
  - **Be specific:** Mention exactly what you want to know or the format of the answer you need.
    - Instead of: “Tell me about photosynthesis,” try: “Can you explain photosynthesis in 3 steps?”
  - **Set a role or scenario:** Tell ChatGPT to act in a certain way, such as being a teacher, a journalist, or even a friend.
    - Example: “Explain the Civil War like you’re my history teacher.”
  - **Limit the response:** You can control the length of the response.
    - Example: “Summarize World War II in 5 sentences.”
  
#### **5. Practice Crafting Prompts for Different Responses (Activity)**
- **Activity Instructions:**
  - Have students pair up to practice crafting prompts. Each pair will write two prompts for the same topic—one formal and one casual.
    - Topic examples: “Explain the water cycle,” “Describe the importance of recycling,” “How does electricity work?”
  - After writing their prompts, students will use ChatGPT to get responses and compare how the tone or style changes based on the prompt they gave.
- **Discussion:** 
  - Ask the pairs to share their prompts and responses. Discuss why their specific prompts led to different responses and what they learned about controlling tone and clarity.

#### **6. Group Activity: Prompt Comparison**
- **Instructions:**
  - Each pair reads out one of their prompts and the response they got.
  - As a group, discuss which prompts were clearer and more detailed, and how the changes affected the response quality.
  - Encourage students to think about what makes a prompt effective, and what they would change in their prompts if they could improve them.

### **Homework:**
- **Assignment:** 
  - Create a prompt to explain a school subject (e.g., history or science) in **simple terms**. This is an exercise to practice crafting clear, specific prompts.
    - Example: “Explain how the Earth revolves around the sun like I’m in 7th grade.”
  - Ask students to share their response in the next class and discuss why the response was good or how it could be improved.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **A good prompt is specific and clear.** It tells ChatGPT exactly what you want to know and sometimes even how to say it.
- **You can change the tone or style of responses** by adjusting the way you ask your question.
- **Practice is important** to learn how to guide ChatGPT to give you the response that’s most useful for you.
