#### **Objective:**

Students will learn how to guide ChatGPT to behave in specific ways by crafting advanced prompts that set roles and formats for responses.

### **Talking Points:**

#### **1. Introduction to Advanced Prompting**

- **Ask the class:**
  - "Have you ever thought about how ChatGPT can act like different people or professionals?"
  - Explain: With advanced prompting techniques, you can ask ChatGPT to behave as if it’s a teacher, a doctor, a historian, or any other role you need. This helps generate specific kinds of information and keeps the responses focused.
  
- **Why is this useful?**
  - Setting a role can make ChatGPT’s responses more accurate for the situation. For example, if you’re studying history, you can ask ChatGPT to respond as if it’s a historian.
  - **Real-life application:** This technique is great for asking for professional advice or explanations in a certain field.

#### **2. Using Advanced Prompts to Set Roles**

- **Explain Role-Based Prompting:**
  - You can guide ChatGPT by telling it to act as if it’s a specific professional or in a specific scenario.
  - **Example Prompts:**
    - “Act like a teacher and explain the causes of the American Revolution.”
    - “Pretend you’re a doctor. What advice would you give someone with a cold?”
    - “As a lawyer, how would you explain the importance of contracts?”

- **Interactive Demo:**
  - Show students how setting a role changes the tone and style of ChatGPT’s response.
    - First, ask a general prompt: “Explain the importance of exercise.”
    - Then, ask: “Act like a personal trainer and explain the importance of exercise.”
  - Point out how the second response is more specific and fits the role of a personal trainer.

#### **3. Crafting Prompts that Require ChatGPT to Stay in a Specific Format**

- **Explain Structured Prompts:**
  - Sometimes, you need ChatGPT to give information in a specific format, like bullet points, numbered lists, or in a step-by-step guide.
  
- **Example Prompts for Structured Responses:**
  - “Act like a teacher and explain how to solve a math problem step by step.”
  - “Write a list of pros and cons of renewable energy like you’re an environmental scientist.”
  
- **Interactive Activity:**
  - Show the difference between asking a general question and one that requires a structured format.
    - General: “What are some benefits of recycling?”
    - Structured: “Act like an environmental scientist and explain the benefits of recycling in a numbered list.”
  
- **Discussion:**
  - Talk about how these prompts are more specific and useful when you need detailed or structured information.

#### **4. Group Work: Teams Create a Role-Based Prompt**

- **Instructions:**
  - Divide students into small groups.
  - Each group will create a prompt that requires ChatGPT to behave like a specific professional. They can choose any role: doctor, lawyer, historian, scientist, etc.
  
- **Examples:**
  - “Act like a lawyer and explain why contracts are important.”
  - “Pretend you are a historian. Explain the key events of World War II.”
  - “Act like a doctor and explain the steps someone should take to stay healthy during flu season.”
  
- **Group Discussion:**
  - After crafting their prompts, each group will share their prompt and the response from ChatGPT. Discuss how setting the role changed the quality of the response and whether it matched their expectations.

### **Homework:**

- **Assignment:**
  - Write a detailed prompt that asks ChatGPT to act like a specific professional, such as a doctor, teacher, or tutor.
  - **Example:** “Act like a science teacher and explain how volcanoes form.”
  - Compare this to a general prompt like “Explain how volcanoes form.” Analyze how the response changes when you ask ChatGPT to act in a role, and discuss how the detail and tone are different.
  
- **Bring your prompt and analysis** to the next class to discuss how the role-based prompt impacted the response.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **Role-based prompting** allows you to guide ChatGPT’s behavior to give more accurate, detailed, and professional responses.
- **Structured prompts** help you get information in a specific format (lists, steps, etc.), making the information more useful for certain tasks.
- Learning how to craft advanced prompts gives you more control over the kind of answers ChatGPT provides, making it a more effective tool for school and personal projects.
