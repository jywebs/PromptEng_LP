### **Week 7: Preparing for the Capstone Project**

#### **Objective:**

Students will plan and brainstorm ideas for their final capstone project, either individually or in groups, and start outlining how they will use prompts in their project.

---

### **Talking Points:**

#### **1. Introduction to the Capstone Project**

- **Explain:**
  - The capstone project is a chance for students to showcase everything they’ve learned about using ChatGPT over the past few weeks. It’s the final assignment that will wrap up the course.
  
- **Project Options:**
  - Students can choose to work individually or in groups to create something meaningful using ChatGPT prompts.
  - The project should demonstrate effective use of prompting techniques, including role-based prompts and structured prompts.
  - Examples of potential projects include:
    - A **study guide** for a school subject.
    - A **personal portfolio**, like a resume and cover letter.
    - An **informational guide** on a topic of interest (science, history, etc.).
    - A set of **flashcards** or **practice questions** for a test.

#### **2. Group Discussion: Brainstorming Ideas**

- **Activity:**
  - Open the floor for a **brainstorming session** where students share their ideas for what they want to create for their capstone project.
  
- **Questions to ask the class:**
  - "What are some school subjects or topics that interest you?"
  - "How can you use ChatGPT to help you create something that’s useful to you or others?"
  - "Would you prefer to work alone or in a group? Why?"

- **Write down ideas:**
  - As students brainstorm, list out potential project ideas on the screen or board. Encourage them to think creatively and consider different ways they can use ChatGPT’s features (like role-based prompting or structured responses) in their projects.

---

#### **3. Assign Roles Within Teams (for Group Projects)**

- **Explain:**
  - If students choose to work in groups, each team will need to assign roles to ensure that everyone contributes to the project. These roles might include:
    - **Project leader:** Organizes the team and makes sure everyone is on track.
    - **Prompt creator:** Writes the prompts that ChatGPT will respond to.
    - **Editor:** Reviews and edits the responses to make sure they are well-structured and accurate.
    - **Presenter:** Prepares the final presentation of the project.
  
- **Activity:**
  - For students working in groups, give them time to **assign roles** and start discussing how they’ll divide tasks.

#### **4. Begin Outlining the Capstone Project**

- **Explain the Outline:**
  - Whether students are working individually or in groups, they should start creating an outline of their project. This outline will guide how they plan to use ChatGPT prompts to achieve their final product.
  
- **What to include in the outline:**
  - **Title of the project:** What is the focus? (e.g., study guide for math, personal portfolio, informational guide on climate change)
  - **Goal:** What do they hope to create? How will it be helpful or meaningful?
  - **Types of prompts they’ll use:** Will they use role-based prompts, structured prompts, or general prompts? How will they guide ChatGPT to get the responses they need?
  - **Plan for using ChatGPT:** How many prompts will they write? What type of information are they looking for from ChatGPT?

- **Group/Individual Work:**
  - Give students time to start working on their outline and draft a few example prompts they plan to use in their project. Encourage them to experiment with ChatGPT during this time.

---

### **Homework:**

- **Assignment:**
  - **Work on the capstone project outline** at home. Continue drafting the outline and finalize 3-5 prompts that will be used in the project.
  - **Test the prompts** with ChatGPT to see how well the responses align with the project’s goal.
  - Be prepared to share the outline and prompts with the class during the next session for feedback and final adjustments.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

- The capstone project is a way to showcase everything you’ve learned about prompting ChatGPT.
- **Brainstorming and planning** are important to make sure the project is meaningful and well-organized.
- Using **advanced prompting techniques** (role-based, structured, etc.) will help guide ChatGPT to give more effective and useful responses for your project.
