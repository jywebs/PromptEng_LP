### **Week 5: Ethical Use of AI (Avoiding Plagiarism)**

#### **Objective:**

Students will learn how to use ChatGPT responsibly, understanding plagiarism and how to avoid it by rewording responses and using ChatGPT as a tool, not a shortcut.

---

### **Talking Points:**

#### **1. Introduction to Plagiarism**

- **Ask the class:**
  - "What do you think plagiarism is?"
  - Discuss student responses and provide a definition: Plagiarism is when you copy someone else’s words or ideas and present them as your own, without giving credit.
  
- **Why is it important to avoid plagiarism?**
  - **Integrity:** Plagiarism is dishonest. If you use someone else’s work without credit, you’re not showing your own abilities.
  - **Learning:** Copying doesn’t help you learn. It’s better to use your own words to show that you understand a topic.
  - **Consequences:** Many schools and jobs have strict rules against plagiarism. It can lead to serious penalties, like failing an assignment.

#### **2. Good vs. Bad Use of ChatGPT**

- **Explain:**
  - ChatGPT is a helpful tool for learning and researching, but it should never be used to copy and paste answers as if they were your own work.
  - **Good Use:**
    - You can use ChatGPT to help **understand** a difficult concept, get ideas, or see how something is explained.
  - **Bad Use:**
    - Copying a response word-for-word and turning it in as your own homework or project is plagiarism.
  
- **Examples of Good and Bad Use:**
  - **Bad Use Example:**
    - A student asks ChatGPT to explain a topic, copies the answer, and submits it directly for an essay.
  - **Good Use Example:**
    - A student asks ChatGPT to explain a topic, reads the explanation, and then **rephrases it** in their own words to show they’ve understood it.
  
- **Interactive Demo:**
  - Show a simple prompt like: “Explain the water cycle.”
  - Copy ChatGPT’s response and show how submitting that directly would be plagiarism.
  - Then, show how to reword the response to make it original, keeping the main ideas but using different phrasing.

#### **3. Practice Rewording ChatGPT Responses (Activity)**

- **Instructions:**
  - Split the students into pairs or small groups.
  - Each group will take a simple response from ChatGPT and practice rewording it in their own words.
  - **Example Prompt:**
    - “Explain why recycling is important.”
  - **ChatGPT Response:** “Recycling helps reduce waste by turning used materials into new products, which conserves natural resources and reduces pollution.”
  - **Rewording:** Guide the students to change the wording while keeping the meaning: “Recycling cuts down on waste by making old items into new ones. This helps save resources and lowers pollution.”
  
- **Group Discussion:**
  - After groups finish rewording, have them share their rephrased responses.
  - Discuss how each group made changes and what they learned about rephrasing.

#### **4. How to Use ChatGPT as a Tool, Not a Shortcut**

- **Discussion Prompt:**
  - “How can we use ChatGPT to help with learning without relying on it as a shortcut?”
  - Encourage students to think of ways ChatGPT can support their learning, such as:
    - Getting ideas for a project.
    - Helping understand a tough topic by breaking it down.
    - Using it to generate **practice questions** or create **study guides**.
  
- **Emphasize:**
  - ChatGPT should be seen as a **tool** to help with learning, just like textbooks or the internet, but it should never replace doing your own work.
  - **Good habits include:**
    - Reading ChatGPT’s answers and then **writing your own version.**
    - Using ChatGPT for practice or brainstorming, but always completing assignments in your own words.

---

### **Homework:**

- **Assignment:**
  - Pick a topic you’re learning about in school (e.g., a science concept or history event).
  - **Ask ChatGPT to explain the topic.**
  - Read the response and **rewrite the explanation** in your own words.
  - Next week, you’ll share your reworded explanation and discuss how you rephrased the information.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **Plagiarism is wrong** because it involves copying someone else’s work without credit, and it stops you from learning.
- **ChatGPT is a tool** that can help you understand and research topics, but you should always **reword its responses** in your own voice.
- Using ChatGPT responsibly means **learning from it** and showing your understanding through original work.
