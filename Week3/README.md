### **Talking Points:**

#### **1. Introduction to Personal Writing:**

- **Ask the class:**
  - "Have any of you ever written or seen a resume before? How about a cover letter?"
  - Explain: Resumes and cover letters are important tools that people use to apply for jobs. A **resume** lists your skills, experiences, and education, while a **cover letter** explains why you are a good fit for a specific job.
  
- **Why is it important?**
  - These documents help you present yourself professionally. Even though most of you aren’t looking for jobs yet, it’s great practice for the future and helps you organize your achievements and skills.

#### **2. How to Write a Resume (Using ChatGPT)**

- **Define a Resume:**
  - A resume is a summary of your education, skills, and experience.
  - Typical sections include: Name and contact info, education, work experience (if any), skills, and sometimes hobbies or extracurricular activities.
  
- **Explain:**
  - A resume shows people what you’re good at and what experiences you’ve had that can help you in the job you want.
  - Even if you haven’t had a job yet, you can still create a resume using **school activities, volunteer work, or hobbies** that show your skills.

#### **3. How ChatGPT Can Help with Resume Writing**

- **Introduce Prompt Crafting for Resume Building:**
  - Tell the class that they will be using ChatGPT as a "career counselor" to help them write their resumes.
  - **Example Prompt:**
    - “Act like a career counselor and help me create a resume. I’m a student and I’ve done the following activities: played soccer, volunteered at a pet shelter, and participated in a science club.”

- **Demonstrate how ChatGPT responds:**
  - Show a live example of ChatGPT creating a simple resume based on that information. You can ask it to include specific sections like education, skills, and hobbies.
  
- **Explain:**
  - The prompt gives ChatGPT enough information to craft a resume. The more details you give, the better it can help you create a professional-looking document.

#### **4. How to Write a Cover Letter (Using ChatGPT)**

- **Define a Cover Letter:**
  - A cover letter is a short letter you write to explain why you are the best person for a job. It goes with your resume when you apply for jobs.
  - **Basic structure of a cover letter:**
    1. Introduction: Who you are and what you’re applying for.
    2. Body: Why you think you’re a good fit for the position.
    3. Conclusion: Thank them for considering you.
  
- **ChatGPT for Cover Letters:**
  - **Example Prompt:**
    - “Write a cover letter for me. I’m a student applying for a summer job at an animal shelter. I love animals, have volunteered at shelters, and I’m responsible and hardworking.”

- **Show how ChatGPT can help:**
  - Walk through the cover letter that ChatGPT generates, explaining each part: the greeting, introduction, body, and conclusion.

#### **5. Group Work: Creating Resumes Using ChatGPT**

- **Instructions:**
  - Split students into pairs or small groups.
  - Each group will create a resume using ChatGPT. They can choose to make a resume for a fictional character (like a superhero, book character, or historical figure) or create one based on their own achievements.
  
- **Example Prompts:**
  - "Act like a career counselor and help me create a resume for Spider-Man. He’s a high school student, and he has experience in saving the city, working as a photographer, and leading team projects."
  - Or: "Act like a career counselor and help me create a resume for myself. I’m a student and I’m good at math, play soccer, and love drawing."
  
- **Explain:**
  - The goal is to practice giving ChatGPT clear instructions and to see how it helps organize personal information into a resume.
  
- **Sharing:**
  - After creating their resumes, groups will share them with the class. Discuss how each resume reflects the skills and experiences of the chosen character or student.
