### **Talking Points:**

#### **1. Introduction to AI**
- **Start with a simple question:** 
  - "Have you ever heard of AI? What do you think it means?"
- **Definition:** 
  - AI stands for **Artificial Intelligence**. It’s when computers and machines are programmed to do tasks that normally require human intelligence. Examples include recognizing speech, solving problems, and learning from data.
- **Everyday Examples of AI:**
  - Virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa.
  - Self-driving cars.
  - Video game characters that respond to your actions.
  - Recommendation systems (Netflix or YouTube suggesting videos you might like).
  
#### **2. What is ChatGPT?**
- **Introduce ChatGPT:** 
  - ChatGPT is a type of AI, called a **language model**. It can read and write text and have conversations with you.
  - It’s like talking to a very smart computer that has learned from a lot of information.
  - **Example:** If you ask ChatGPT a question, it will respond based on everything it’s been trained on.
  
#### **3. How Does ChatGPT Work?**
- **Explain:** 
  - ChatGPT has been trained on text from books, websites, and conversations. It uses that training to try and give you helpful answers.
  - When you type in a question or ask for help, that’s called a **prompt**.

#### **4. What is a Prompt?**
- **Definition:**
  - A **prompt** is a question or instruction you give to ChatGPT to get a response.
  - **Example Prompts:**
    - “Tell me a joke.”
    - “Explain how plants grow.”
    - “What are some fun facts about space?”
  - **Explain:** The better and more detailed your prompt, the better the response. If you’re too vague, the response might not be as useful.
  
#### **5. Why Are Prompts Important?**
- **Interactive Discussion:** 
  - Ask students, "What do you think would happen if you only ask ChatGPT 'Tell me about history'? How could you improve that?"
  - Guide them to understand that **specific prompts** get better answers.

#### **6. Basic Example Prompts and Responses:**
- **Show examples:** 
  - Type a few simple prompts into ChatGPT (live demo or screenshots).
  - Compare short, unclear prompts vs. detailed prompts.
    - Short: “Tell me about animals.”
    - Detailed: “Tell me about the life cycle of a butterfly.”
- **Explain:** Notice how being specific gives you a much more detailed response.

### **Hands-on Practice:**

#### **7. Crafting a Basic Prompt (Activity)**
- **Explain the Activity:**
  - Now, it's your turn to try creating prompts! Think of something you want to know more about or something fun like asking for a joke or story.
- **Instructions:**
  - Ask students to write a simple prompt on their own, like: 
    - “Explain why the sky is blue.”
    - “Give me tips for studying math.”
  - Encourage creativity and curiosity!
  
#### **8. Discussion After Practice:**
- **Share and Reflect:** 
  - Ask a few students to share their prompts and the response they got.
  - Discuss: "Did the response match what you expected? If not, how could you change your prompt to make it clearer?"

### **Homework:**
- **Assignment:** 
  - Write 3 prompts at home using ChatGPT. Choose different types (a question about school, a fun fact, and a story request). Write down the best response and explain why you think it was effective.
  - Bring your prompts and responses to class next week to discuss.

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **AI is all around us**, helping with everyday tasks.
- **ChatGPT is an AI that talks with you** by using prompts.
- **Crafting good prompts** is important because it helps ChatGPT give better answers.
